# Jumia_Data_Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in MS Excel through dashboards and tables to analyze the data.  Data cleaning, processing, and visualization were part of my data analysis process.
# Data-Analysis-for-Jumia (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and build an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes the performance of products listed on Jumia.
## Dataset Used

## Cleaning and Enrichment
-	I had blanks in the rating column, so I filled them with the column's average.
-	The review column had negatives, so I used the Find & Replace function to change the negatives to positives.
-	Created Discount Amount (KSh): Old Price minus Current Price
-	Created rating category: Poor=below 3, Average=3-4.4 and, Excellent is above 4.5
-	Created Discount Category: Low=below 20%, Medium=20-40% and High is above 40%
## Key Findings
-	High discounts does not lead to a high number of reviews.
-	An excellent rating has more number of reviews
-	Higher Discounts lead to more customer engagement
-	Low-discounted products are highly rated with fewer reviews, while the highly discounted products are low-rated with a high number of reviews.
